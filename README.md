# MIPS Architecture
  The MIPS32 instruction set is an instruction set standard published in 1999. Currently, the MIP32 instruction set is the most common MIPS instruction set, compatible with most CPUs. Due to its re- lative simplicity, it is also the most common instruction set taught in computer architecture university courses. In this project, I will implement a simplified version of the MIPS32 Architecture using Java as a programming language.
